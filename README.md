# Binary Number Gap Assignment

This program generates binary numbers from 1 to N and calculates the longest sequence of zeros in the binary representation of N.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

The program requires Python 3 to be installed on your system.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

`
git clone https://github.com/surries006/binary-number-gap.git
`

2. Navigate to the project directory.

`
cd binary-number-gap
`

## Usage

1. Run the `binarynumber.py` file.

`
python binarynumber.py
`

2. Enter a positive integer N. The program will generate binary numbers from 1 to N and calculate the longest sequence of zeros in the binary representation of N.

3. You can choose to input another number or exit the program.

## Example

```
Please input a whole number: 9
Binary numbers between 1 and 9 are:  1, 10, 11, 100, 101, 110, 111, 1000, 1001. 

The binary gap of 9 is 2.

Do you want to input another number? (y/n) :n
You are now exiting the program...
Thank you for trying it out!
```
